His career in the world of computing began with programming in Basic, Pascal, Clipper, and C++, later expanding to PHP, Python, MySQL, editing software such as Photoshop and Lightroom, and the use of Artificial Intelligence applications for multimedia content production.

As a trainer, he has led courses on the conscious use of the Internet and prepared candidates for the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) exam. He is the author of the book "Patente Europea per il Computer: Strategie Pratiche ed Esercizi per Superare Facilmente l'Esame ECDL" (European Computer Licence: Practical Strategies and Exercises to Easily Pass the ECDL Exam), published by Bruno Editore, which synthesizes his teaching experience into a practical and accessible guide.

He recently co-authored "Guida pratica all'uso delle Intelligenze Artificiali" (Practical Guide to Using Artificial Intelligence), a free e-book that represents a journey from the basics to the present day of this new technology. In parallel, he has conducted both practical and theoretical courses on Artificial Intelligence.

As co-founder and manager of verbanianotizie.it, he created an online information platform that, with over 2 million visitors since 2012, has become a point of reference for events, politics, and news in Verbania and its province. The portal stands out for its particular attention to the voices of citizens and their concerns, collaborating with various professionals to develop thematic columns.

His social commitment materialized in a digital volunteering initiative: the free creation of websites for approximately 20 local associations, spanning from sports to support for the elderly, from assistance for women in difficulty to health prevention, and even help for local children.

A significant project was the development and management of content for a portal dedicated to hiking in the Verbano-Cusio-Ossola province, which contributed to the promotion of the area and its natural beauty.
